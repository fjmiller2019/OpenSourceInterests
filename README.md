# OpenSourceInterests
This project is a public listing of open source projects that I've found interesting and wish to follow and potentially contribute to in the future. As my primary coding languages are currently Python and Javascript, these are the languages that I have the most interest in. 

Django - https://github.com/django/django

Django, with it's catchy slogan, "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines", is a powerful open source web framework written in Python. Django is a good web framework, as it can handle most of the heavy lifting for you, if you know what you're doing.

Atom - https://github.com/atom/atom

Atom is a hackable text editor that works well for a variety of programing and scripting langauges. It's strength comes from the fact that, as an open source project, you can get it to do almost anything you want, with the right amount of work. It is written in Javascript, and is widely used.

Reddit Enhancement Suite - https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite

The Reddit Enhancement Suite is an open source project in javascript to enhance Reddit, a widely used news and discussion site. The Enhancement suite offers a variety of features that Reddit itself does not natively offer, including multiple account support, user interface enchancements, and more comment features. 

SerpentAI - https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI

SerpentAI is an open source Python project to write universal game AI. The goal of the project is to create a simple, easy to use framework to assist developers in creating agents to play various games. 

Node.js - https://github.com/nodejs/node

Node.js is a revolutionary javascript runtime enviourment that allows you to run javascript outside of a browser. This has enabled javascript to make the leap from a niche language to one of the most commonly used programing lanagues over the last 5 years. It allows you to build javascript projects that work indepenantly of a browser, and enables you to build quick, effiecient, and fast API services, among other things.
